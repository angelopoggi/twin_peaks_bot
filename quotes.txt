TAKE ANOTHER LOOK SONNY, IT'S GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN
YOU ARE WITNESSING A FRONT THREE QUARTER VIEW OF TWO ADULTS SHARING A TENDER MOMENT
YOU REMIND ME TODAY OF A SMALL MEXICAN CHIHUAHUA
WHAT THE HELL?
THATS THE KIND OF GIRL THAT MAKES YOU WISH YOU SPOKE A LITTLE FRENCH!
YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK UP. HEARING'S GONE. LONG STORY. GOT THESE THINGS CRANKED UP TO THE MAX.
APOLOGIES IN ADVANCE FOR ALBERT.
THERE'S ROOM IN THIS FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION FOR MORE THAN ONE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, DENISE.
IT IS THRILLING, DENISE
I'M OLD SCHOOL, DENISE. YOU KNOW THAT. BEFORE YOU WERE DENISE, WHEN YOU WERE DENNIS AND I WAS YOUR BOSS, WHEN I HAD YOU WORKING UNDERCOVER AT THE DEA, YOU WERE A CONFUSED AND WILD THING SOMETIMES. I HAD ENOUGH DIRT ON YOU TO FILL THE GRAND CANYON - AND I NEVER USED A SPOONFUL BECAUSE YOU WERE AND ARE A GREAT AGENT. AND WHEN YOU BECAME DENISE, I TOLD ALL YOUR COLLEAGUES, THOSE CLOWN COMICS, TO FIX THEIR HEARTS OR DIE.
SOUTH DAKOTA, DENISE. HE'S IN A FEDERAL PRISON IN SOUTH DAKOTA. WE'RE GOING OUT TO SEE HIM TOMORROW.
AS HAPPY AS THIS NEWS MAKES US, ALBERT, WE CAN'T PUT THIS ON THE RADIO.
ALBERT, WE'RE HEADED TO THE BLACK HILLS OF SOUTH DAKOTA.
COOP! THEY SAY THAT LOVE MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND, MAKES PEOPLE WHO NEED PEOPLE THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. ALTHOUGH THEY NEVER SAID A DOG GUN THING ABOUT A CURE FOR HEARING LOSS.
WHAT A BEAUTY. REMINDS ME OF THAT STATUE, THE BABE WITHOUT THE ARMS.
DON'T LET'EM RATTLE YOU, COOP. THESE GUYS MAKE A LIVING LOOKING THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE'S DRAWERS. MAY A SMILE BE YOUR UMBRELLA. WE'VE ALL HAD OUR SOCKS TOSSED AROUND. CATCH YOU LATER.
HEADIN' ON OVER TO BEND, OREGON. WHOLE LOTTA SHAKIN' GOING ON IN BEND!
AGENT TAMMY PRESTON HAS THE STUFF, DENISE.
SMOKE? ASK MACKLEY WHEN HE GETS BACK.
WE ARE LIKE THE DREAMER WHO DREAMS AND THEN LIVES INSIDE THE DREAM.
